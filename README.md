# PrimeBasket - Online Shopping Platform

PrimeBasket is a simple online shopping platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling. It provides basic e-commerce functionalities like product listings, cart management, user authentication (login/signup), and theme customization.

## Features

- **Product Listings:** Displays a list of featured products on the homepage.
- **Shopping Cart:** Allows users to add products to a cart, view and manage cart items, and see the total price.
- **User Authentication:** Includes login and signup pages for user accounts (basic front-end implementation).
- **Theme Toggle:** Users can switch between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.
- **Contact Form:** A contact section is available for users to send messages or feedback.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Homepage with product listings and hero section.
- `cart.html`: Shopping cart page to view and manage selected items.
- `login.html`: Login page for user authentication.
- `signup.html`: Signup page for creating new user accounts.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration file for theme customization and styling.
- `image-logo.png`: Logo image for the PrimeBasket website.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS

## Usage

To run this project, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Customization

- **Tailwind CSS:**  Customize the styling and theme by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file. You can change colors, fonts, and other design aspects.
- **Product Data:**  Product information is currently hardcoded in `index.html`. To make it dynamic, you would need to integrate with a backend service or use JavaScript to fetch product data from a JSON file or API.
- **Functionality:** This is a basic front-end project. To add real e-commerce functionality (like payments, order processing, database integration), you would need to develop a backend and integrate it with this front-end.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement backend integration for dynamic product data and user accounts.
- Add payment gateway integration for processing orders.
- Improve user interface and user experience.
- Add more product categories and features.
